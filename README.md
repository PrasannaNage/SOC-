Deep Reinforcement Learning with OpenAI Gym in Python:

A Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent is trained to play the CartPole-v1 environment from the OpenAI Gym using this code.
First, the state and action spaces are established, and the environment is initialized. 
TensorFlow's Keras API is used to construct a neural network model with three dense layers: an output layer with linear activation corresponding to the action space, and two hidden layers with 24 neurons each and ReLU activation.
The Adam optimizer is used in the compilation of the DQN agent, which is set up with a sequential memory for experience replay and a Boltzmann Q-policy for action selection.
After training for 100,000 steps, the agent's performance is assessed throughout ten episodes, and the rewards are plotted to show the agent's progress.
